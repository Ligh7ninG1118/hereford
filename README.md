# Hereford
Hereford is an FPS demo planned to recreate the CQB test from the F.N.G. level of *Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare*. 
The demo is developed using a simple game engine made from scratch, with **SDL2** and **OpenGL**. 

The project's main purpose is for me to learn more about game engine development, modern C++ and features
(Also, to pay homeage to the great game that inspired me to become a game developer)
