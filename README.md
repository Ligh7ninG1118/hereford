# Hereford
Hereford is a FPS demo planned to recreate the CQB test from the F.N.G. level of *Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare*. 
The demo would be developed using a simple game engine coded from scratch, with **SDL2** and **OpenGL**. 

The project's main purpose is for me to learn more about game engine, modern C++ and features from Cpp20/17/14/11
(Also, pay homeage to the great game that inspired me to become a game developer)
